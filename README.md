## Overview

Welcome to my HW4 repository for INST-335! It contains all required files for the assignment, and focuses on demonstrating proficiency in the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis in Python using the `fastfood.csv` dataset.

This repository includes the following:

1. `README.md`: This file.
2. `data/fastfood.csv`: The raw CSV dataset containing nutritional information.
3. `analyze_data.py`: Python script containing all pandas operations.
4. `report.md`: A written report summarizing the analysis.


## Running the Script

This data analysis script requires the installation of the Python and the pandas libraries.

1.  Installing dependencies (if necessary):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

2.  Ensuring the data file is present:
    Verify that the `fastfood.csv` file is placed inside a folder named `data` in the project root directory.

3.  Running the analysis script:
    Execute the Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python analyze_data.py
    ```
